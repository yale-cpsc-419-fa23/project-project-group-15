# IM Calendar Project

Created by Oz Gitelson, Dylan Bober, Joel Banks, and Brian Di Bassinga

Currently there is a lack of centralization of Intramural sporting (IM) events at Yale. This app provides a centralized calendar for Yale events, with live ranking information and many other features to further connect the Yale IM community and boost college-wide spirit.

## Features
* Calendar of IM Events
* Sorting and search by sport/college/date
* Student signup and Login via Yale CAS
* Venue
* List of players currently signed up
* College Leaderboard (which college wins the most)
* IM Secretaries can add events via a GUI
